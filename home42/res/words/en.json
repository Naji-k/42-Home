Besides basic functionality the buddy list was added to find your friends more easily.",

After many breaks, modifications, reiterations, abandonments for conflicting reasons with the 42 API, the project was resumed seriously at the beginning of 2022 and a first production version was made available in the same fall.",

    "credits.faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqq1": "Is this app intended to replace intra on mobile?",
    "faq1": "No, the app basically does what remains essential for a 42 student, view profiles, clusters, events, projects and gain knowledge through earning. Some features and actions simply remain unavailable with the current API.",
    "faqq2": "The graph is not displayed in the same way as on the intra is it serious doctor?",
    "faq2": "No, this app only displays the information returned to it by the \"\/project_data\" call from the intra (the API does not allow you to build the graph). Valuable information is missing to build the graph correctly visually. It would be time and energy consuming to make the application always in sync by making patches by hand, plus the application would need to update constantly.",
    "faqq3": "Some pages display a \"!\" Why ?",
    "faq3": "The API can return erroneous results, these indicators are there to warn you not to rely 100% on the results.",
    "faqq4": "What technologies are used for this app?",
    "faq4": "This app is developed in Apple's Swift language (version 5.7 and later). Minimum requirements are iOS 15 and Xcode 14 respectively.\n The interface mainly uses the UIKit framework, for widgets we will find the SwiftUI framework. Dependencies are used to manage by CocoaPods:\n - To encrypt user data\n - Better handle text formatting for dates in all languages",
    "faqq5": "Will this app become available for Android?",
    "faq5": "No. This focus is to develop a native iOS app for a great user experience.",
    "faqq6": "My profile photo on intra was changed, but I don't see any change in the app?",
    "faq6": " When an intra photo changes the application may still display the old photo: simply delete the cache in the settings to force a new download. For speed improvements profile pictures are cached locally. To delete or to know the size consumed by each \"cache\", go to the settings and access the \"cache\" section.",
    "faqq7": "I found a bug! What shall I do ?",
    "faq7": "Nobody is perfect, sorry! ;) Literally shake your iPhone when you are connected and an email will be generated with crucial information on the state of your application. Please remember to add your description of the problem and how you got there. And please be patient, as this is just a hobby project of mine.",
    "faqq8": "Does the application use services like Google Analytics?",
    "faq8": "No third party tracking services are used, so your data will will stay confidential. We are counting on you to provide feedback on the application to better understand what works well, what does not work, what is not intuitive, what is really used, and ideas for future updates. Simply shake your iPhone and write us!",
    "faqq9": "The cluster overview of my campus is not available: is there a way to have it in a next update?",
    "faq9": "Go to the Guides section at the bottom of your screen in the settings and follow the explanations and we happily include it in the next update.",
    "faqq10": "I can't spend my Wallets in the store? I also see articles not visible on my intranet.",
    "faq10": "The store presents the products of all the campuses, moreover, the API does not allow anything to buy.",
    "faqq11": "Why are the lists of logins displayed from Z to A?",
    "faq11": "The API does not offer a filter to not display \"3b3-XXXX\" anonymized profiles so to avoid paging through hundreds of results containing anonymized profiles, logins are displayed from Z to A.",
